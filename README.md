The repo is about creating a algorithm which helps to protect a network against DDOS , brute force password hacking through Indirect Connections.
We will be modifying the RC4 algorithm such that we protect our network against DDOS and brute force which involves trying every possible password.
The basic idea will be time limited packet exchange policy which will allow only certain amount of packets to get exchange for making connections.
